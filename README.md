Besides, back in time, I was researching for a method to convert my code into one of the application development languages. Finally, I found Xamarin. 

Xamarin is an open-source platform for building modern and performant applications for iOS, Android, and Windows with . NET. Xamarin is an abstraction layer that manages communication of shared code with underlying platform code. Xamarin apps are native apps and most apps will behave the way users expect. Xamarin extends the .NET developer platform with tools and libraries specifically for building apps for Android, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, macOS, and Windows.

The android application is also available to download and review in the code folder.
